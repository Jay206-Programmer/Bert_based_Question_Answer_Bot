Of the nearly 30 million recorded infections to date, the vast majority of people experienced mild or moderate disease—which itself can range from no symptoms at all to pneumonia or long-term, debilitating neurological symptoms. A minority ended up with severe respiratory symptoms but eventually recovered. And some—nearly 940,000 worldwide, of which 196,000 are in the US—took a turn for the worse and died.\n","Why some people die while others recover is thought to depend in large part on the human immune response, which spirals out of control in severe disease. Over the past few months, researchers have developed a better understanding of this dysfunctional immune response. By comparing patients with varying degrees of disease severity, they’ve catalogued a number of dramatic changes across the human immune arsenal that are often apparent when patients first come into the hospital—from signaling cytokine proteins and first-responder cells of the innate immune system, to the B cells and T cells that confer pathogen-specific adaptive immunity.\n","The factors that trigger this immune dysregulation have so far remained elusive due to the complexity of the immune system, which consists of seemingly endless biological pathways that twist and turn and feed back on one another like a ball of spaghetti. But researchers—drawing on knowledge from other conditions such as sepsis, cancer, and autoimmune disease—are gradually building coherent theories of what puts patients en route to severe disease. Along the way, they’re also uncovering signals that clinicians could use to predict disease prognosis and identify potential new treatment avenues.'''\n",",\n","'''The grinning voice of John Denver caroling \"Rocky Mountain High\" may never again seem quite so innocent once you've consumed \"Final Destination,\" the leaden teenage horror film in which the song is repeatedly used to announce the arrival of death (with a capital D).\n","The first time you hear the anthem by the perky folk-pop singer, who died in a plane crash, it is being piped over the sound system at Kennedy Airport minutes before Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), a jittery high school senior, is to board a jet for Paris on his class trip.

Of the nearly 30 million recorded infections to date, the vast majority of people experienced mild or moderate disease—which itself can range from no symptoms at all to pneumonia or long-term, debilitating neurological symptoms. A minority ended up with severe respiratory symptoms but eventually recovered. And some—nearly 940,000 worldwide, of which 196,000 are in the US—took a turn for the worse and died.\\nWhy some people die while others recover is thought to depend in large part on the human immune response, which spirals out of control in severe disease. Over the past few months, researchers have developed a better understanding of this dysfunctional immune response. By comparing patients with varying degrees of disease severity, they’ve catalogued a number of dramatic changes across the human immune arsenal that are often apparent when patients first come into the hospital—from signaling cytokine proteins and first-responder cells of the innate immune system, to the B cells and T cells that confer pathogen-specific adaptive immunity.\\nThe factors that trigger this immune dysregulation have so far remained elusive due to the complexity of the immune system, which consists of seemingly endless biological pathways that twist and turn and feed back on one another like a ball of spaghetti. But researchers—drawing on knowledge from other conditions such as sepsis, cancer, and autoimmune disease—are gradually building coherent theories of what puts patients en route to severe disease. Along the way, they’re also uncovering signals that clinicians could use to predict disease prognosis and identify potential new treatment avenues.'],\n"," ['The grinning voice of John Denver caroling \"Rocky Mountain High\" may never again seem quite so innocent once you\\'ve consumed \"Final Destination,\" the leaden teenage horror film in which the song is repeatedly used to announce the arrival of death (with a capital D).\\nThe first time you hear the anthem by the perky folk-pop singer, who died in a plane crash, it is being piped over the sound system at Kennedy Airport minutes before Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), a jittery high school senior, is to board a jet for Paris on his class trip.
