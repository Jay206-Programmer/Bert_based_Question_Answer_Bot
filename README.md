# Bert based Question Answer Bot (NLP)

This is the project I created for **Lincode's Virtual Hackathon 2020**.

### Features of the Model:

- 🤔 Can find precise answers from **large paragraphs**.

- :rocket: **Very Fast** Responce Time.

- 😎 Use of current State of the Art **BERT** model to Increase _preciseness_.

- ♾ Infinite **Quick** _Question-Answering_ once the model is set on the _paragraph(Data)_.

- ⏳ Can also answer Questions in **Real-time** **without** having to train on **Data Paragraph** using google's **Word2Vec** model.  

- 🌎 _Ready to Deploy_!

### Use Cases:

1) Can be implemented in **Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ)** section for _best user expirience_.

2) **Study Helper:** Just give the model the **paragraphs** you want to extract information from and **just start asking questions!**

3) **Chat-bot**: with some tweaks the model can be transformed into a **Personalised** _Chat-bot_.
